# Forking an App into Your Account

Serverless Cloud allows developers to start working on an existing app to easily add new use cases to the existing application or edit the use cases according to their requirements. Follow the below steps to fork an app from a public profile:

- Click on a forkable app on a repository and in the app detail click on the "Fork App" button. This will initiate the forking process.
- Choose one of your organizations that you want to fork the app into.
- Next, you can update the name of the application or leave it as it is. Note that you’ll be prompted to enter another name if an app with the same name exists in your account.
- Done! The app is now forked into your account. You can now start working on it by downloading it to your local computer and working against your developer sandbox by following the instructions. Note that you can skip the npm install step if you already have the Serverless Cloud installed globally.
